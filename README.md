This derivation and implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to fit a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was an assignment for [a course in advanced computational statistics](https://sph.umich.edu/admissions/courses/course.php?courseID=BIOSTAT815). I'm uploading it here only because it was especially interesting and satisfying to work on :blush:.
